spec:
good 2017 iMac, mojave
westen digital my book 8T

turbo-geth
5/14 execution stage, block/sec is under 100
after an interruption to restart the computer, it drops to 1 block/sec
is it because it loses previous caches?
or that i didnt use ssd external drive?
anyway, i had to stop it and use geth

$ geth --datadir /Volumes/k/e  --syncmode full
Fatal: Error starting protocol stack: listen unix /Volumes/k/e/geth.ipc: bind: invalid argument
google says socket path need be short, so i changed to above, but still not working
fortunately, i found geth has another option --ipcpath, relative to datadir (explicit paths escape it)
$ geth --datadir /Volumes/k/e  --syncmode full --ipcpath /Users/***/Library/Ethereum
hooray! it works. hope it can finish successfully.
